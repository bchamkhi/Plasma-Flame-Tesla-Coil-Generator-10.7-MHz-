# Plasma-Flame-Tesla-Coil-Generator-10.7-MHz-
This is a DIY high-frequency **Plasma Flame Generator** based on a loosely coupled **dual resonant transformer** principle. It uses an IRFP460 MOSFET and feedback coil to self-oscillate and create a stable flame output from a screw electrode on top of the secondary coil.
